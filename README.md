## Background
This project, framed within the subject 'Tipología y ciclo de vida de los datos' of the [Data Science MSc at UOC](https://estudios.uoc.edu/es/masters-universitarios/data-science/presentacion), aims to build a **web scraper with python**. In our case, we decided to build a web scraper to gather information from **[EURAXESS](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu)**, a website that provides worldwide job opportunities in research.

## Justification and project scope  
It is not always easy to find job opportunities if you are interested in beginning to do research in a certain field. In this sense, having an up-to-date dataset with job offers in your field of interest would simplify this search. This dataset could be generated using web scraping methods.

Although the web scraper we built could be applied to every field, in this project we focused in opportunities related with data science (i.e. data scientist, data analyst, data engineer...) published on [EURAXESS](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu).

## Main and specific objectives
The main objective of this project is to **generate a dataset of research opportunities** related with **data science** published on [EURAXESS](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu) **building and applying a web scraper in python**. Besides, we proposed the following specific aims:
+ To perform **Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA)** to investigate generated datasets and summarize key insights.
+ To use **Data visualization** methods to easily interpret the data.

## How to install?
To use this web scraper coded in python, it will be necessary to install the dependencies specified in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/avicenteg/euraxess_scraping/blob/master/scraping/requirements.txt) file on this repository.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
